## 0. Welcome to ITSM Fundamentals
* **Focus:** Setup
* **Summary:** Started by getting oriented with the course, downloading participant guide, and provisioned my personal, hands-on lab instance.

<br>

## 1. Introduction to ITSM Applications
* **Focus:** Architecture
* **Summary:** I explored the baseline architecture of ServiceNow's ITSM applications and completed **Lab 1.2.1** to log in and verify my environment was running correctly.
  
### Lab 1.2.1: Verify ITSM Environment
* I logged into my dedicated instance to validate the baseline infrastructure, configurations, and plugins required for the course (Service Catalog app, Incident management app, problem management app, and change management app)

## 2. Operate IT Services
* **Focus:** Request Management
* **Summary:** I worked with the Service Catalog to handle end-user requests. In **Lab 2.3.1 & Lab 2.3.2**, I practiced submitting catalog items, routing them through approval workflows, and tracking fulfillment tasks.

### Lab 2.3.1: Verify Service Catalog Request and approval
* I submitted a catalog item from the user perspective and routed it through the necessary manager approvals.

##### Submitted a Standard Laptop request (REQ0010001) through the Service Catalog application and confirmed order placement:

##### Submitted a request through the Employee Center portal to verify the alternate submission path:

### Lab 2.3.2: Verify Request Fulfillment And Tracking
* Managed and updated the underlying fulfillment tasks to track the requested item all the way to completion.

Verified requested item RITM0010001 (Lenovo Carbon x1) is visible with approval status and item details, verified requested item task "Items ready to be fulfilled from stock" is present with a start date, and
verified request state shows Stage: Order Fulfillment with Approval: Approved confirming the request progressed correctly:

## 3. Maintain IT Services
* **Focus:** Incident & Problem Management
* **Summary:** I focused on fixing disruptions and finding their root causes. I managed the full lifecycle of logging, investigating, and resolving active incidents (**Labs 3.2.1 & 3.2.2**), adn handled tracking underlying problems to prevent future issues (**Labs 3.3.1 & 3.3.2**).

### Lab 3.2.1: Verify Incident Record Creation Capabilities
* I practiced logging and triaging a new incident to document an active service disruption.

### Lab 3.2.2: Verify Incident Tracking And Resolution Capabilities
* Investigated the disruption, applied a fix, and walked the incident through to formal resolution.

### Lab 3.3.1:Verify Problem Record Creation Capabilities
* Logged a problem record to investigate the underlying root cause behind recurring incidents.

### Lab 3.3.2: Verify Problem Tracking And Resolution Capabilities
* Tracked the root-cause analysis, documented workarounds, and noted the permanent resolution to prevent future disruptions.

## 4. Improve IT Services
* **Focus:** Change Management
* **Summary:** I learned how to push IT infrastructure updates safely while minimizing risk. In **Labs 4.2.1 and 4.2.2**, I created change requests, routed them through necessary approvals, and trcaked them through execution to formal closure.

### Lab 4.2.1: Verify Change creation And Authorization Capabilities
* created a structured change request and routed it through the necessary risk assessments and authorization gates.

### Lab 4.2.2: Verify Change Request Tracking And Closure Capabilities
* Monitored the implementation of the change in the system and successfully closed it out after validating its success.

## 5. Summary and Recap
* **Focus:** Platform Synthesis
* **Summary:** I wrapped up the course by connecting the dots between all four lifecycles, reviewing how requests, incidents, problems, and changes seamlessly share data and interact across the ServiceNow platform.
